# Hermes Desktop Builds

Community builds of the **real Nous Research Hermes Electron Desktop**, with a small,
explicit UI patch applied before building and signing.
This is a build/distribution repository, not a Hermes fork, website wrapper, or the
Tauri `Hermes-Setup` agent bootstrap installer. Not an official Nous Research release.

This publisher is [`jairbj/hermes-desktop-builds`](https://github.com/jairbj/hermes-desktop-builds).
The pipeline was forked from [`frankhommers/hermes-desktop-builds`](https://github.com/frankhommers/hermes-desktop-builds);
releases, Actions and downloads on this repository are independent of that original publisher.

## Distribution status

Use [Latest release](https://github.com/jairbj/hermes-desktop-builds/releases/latest)
on this repository. This publisher does not maintain a Homebrew tap.

The original pipeline withdrew **release and tag 0.17.0.1**. Do not use those Mac ZIPs
if you still have them: they lack CodeResources seals while the Electron executables
retain signatures, producing `code has no resources but signature indicates they must
be present`.

**Gatekeeper still rejects the quarantined ad-hoc publisher.** These are valid code seals,
not Developer ID signing or Apple notarization. Raw per-target evidence and the existing
Linux/Windows upstream test exceptions accompany the release; no failing suite is labelled green.

## Scope

Native CI lanes: macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`), macOS Intel (`x64`), Windows x64,
and Linux x64. Each build packages Electron, the real UI and real native modules.
No Python runtime, agent checkout, venv, credentials or personal backend URL is bundled.
No global installs, signing credentials, sudo or system configuration changes are used.
All caches, source and test homes live in `.work/`; outputs live in `out/`.
Linux CI uses one private short directory under `RUNNER_TEMP` for Chromium socket
files, because its Unix-domain socket paths cannot exceed the kernel length limit.

**Mac builds are ad-hoc signed, not Apple Developer ID signed or notarized.** Windows
builds have no Authenticode signature. A valid Mac signature seals the app contents;
it does not establish an Apple-trusted publisher. Native CI separately records the
Gatekeeper rejection of the quarantined ad-hoc app and never calls that acceptance.
Do not disable OS security or strip quarantine automatically.

## Remote use: important

New patched builds open **Connect to existing Hermes** directly on a clean first start.
They hide the local installation offer (including the alternate install-command screen),
and omit the unused local gateway icons while the active gateway is remote. A genuine
local failure is not hidden as an idle connection. The settings registry is unchanged.
The older 0.17.0.2 release predates this UI patch; patched releases start at 0.17.0.3.

The remote form does not start the local installer. A running remote Hermes
`serve`/dashboard backend is required; no local Node, Python or Hermes CLI is required.

This is **not a hard-locked remote-only fork**: local runtime internals remain intact;
the patch changes presentation, not the backend's installation/discovery capabilities.
If Hermes is already installed locally, upstream discovery may start that existing runtime
before first-run setup. Review your existing client/runtime configuration first; do not
blindly launch on such a machine when local agent startup must be avoided. Runtime
discovery may execute a short system-Python import probe even on an otherwise clean host;
that is not an agent/server startup, and is not a bundled Python runtime.

No live remote credentials/login/WebSocket/chat session is exercised by this build.
The real smoke test checks the first-run UI, remote form, a rejected connection to a
closed loopback port, inactive bootstrap state and the actual packaged native PTY.

## Downloads and installation

Use the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jairbj/hermes-desktop-builds/releases)
page. Only publish a release after all four native lanes pass the distribution gate.
Checksums, source pin and per-platform validation evidence accompany each release.

### macOS

The `darwin-<arch>-adhoc.zip` release ZIP contains a complete, ad-hoc signed `Hermes.app`.
Use the archive for your CPU. Signing happens during the build, never after download.
macOS 12+ is the initial binary metadata floor, not a tested compatibility matrix.

This publisher does not ship a Homebrew cask. Verify the ZIP's SHA256 against `SHA256SUMS`
(`shasum -a 256 <download.zip>`), then use macOS `ditto`, preserving symlinks/modes:

```sh
# Set ZIP to the exact archive you downloaded; do not overwrite an existing app.
ZIP="$HOME/Downloads/<exact-release-filename>.zip"
test ! -e "$HOME/Applications/Hermes.app" &&
  mkdir -p "$HOME/Applications" &&
  /usr/bin/ditto -x -k "$ZIP" "$HOME/Applications"
open "$HOME/Applications/Hermes.app"
```

For an unidentified-developer warning, after verifying origin/checksum, use the
app-specific **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** only if you
trust this build. Never disable Gatekeeper/SIP or broadly remove quarantine.
For “damaged”, `Killed: 9`, a crash or no app-specific exception: stop and diagnose:

```sh
# Use the actual installation path after ditto (often $HOME/Applications).
APP="$HOME/Applications/Hermes.app"
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "$APP"
spctl --assess --type execute -vv "$APP"
```

The `codesign` check MUST pass for the corrected Mac release. `spctl` still rejects
the unnotarized ad-hoc publisher; that is distinct from a damaged bundle. No local
re-signing is necessary. A fully Apple-trusted distribution requires Developer ID
signing and notarization credentials in a separate credentialed release lane.

### Windows

Check SHA256 using `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 <zip>`. Extract the **entire** ZIP
into a new directory, then run `Hermes/Hermes.exe`; do not copy the EXE alone.
Do not disable Defender or SmartScreen. If a policy blocks the untrusted publisher,
stop and use a properly signed distribution rather than bypassing organizational policy.

### Linux

Check `sha256sum <archive.tar.gz>`, extract into a new directory with
`tar -xzf <archive.tar.gz>`, then run `./Hermes/Hermes` in a graphical desktop session.
System Electron/Chromium GUI libraries are required; see the upstream Electron Linux
requirements. The bundled Linux window-enumeration implementation additionally invokes
`xprop` and `xwininfo` against an X11 display; the startup/PTY smoke test does not exercise
that feature or certify native Wayland support. Across platforms, `get-windows` payloads
are inspected, but their actual window-enumeration/permission behavior is not covered by
the native PTY test. This tarball is not a distro package and does not register a launcher.
Linux CI launches the real Electron renderer with `--ozone-platform=headless` and
`--no-sandbox` because hosted/headless environments may restrict
Chromium user namespaces. That flag is **not** baked into the app or normal run advice.

For all platforms choose the existing-remote route and configure your HTTPS backend.
Client replacement does not update your server. Quit the app and keep the previous
version for rollback. Do not delete external client state. The upstream in-app updater
expects a source/agent install and is not the update mechanism for these standalone builds.

## Reproduce

Inspect `upstream.json` for the exact source SHA, source version, build revision and Node
version. Use a **fresh checkout** of this build repo on each native OS with Git, that
Node/npm version, Python >=3.11 and native build tools where dependencies require them.
No Hermes agent installation is needed. This script refuses to reuse an existing `.work/src`.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/build.py --run
```

The build fetches the exact public upstream commit and checks it out without CRLF
conversion, verifies and applies the checked-in UI/test patch, then runs lockfile npm ci
with lifecycle scripts initially disabled, explicitly
installs Electron, then uses upstream build/staging/builder hooks. Native dependencies
are never replaced by stubs. Unknown test failures block the distribution.

The full upstream UI/Electron suite runs on Linux; targeted first-run/native-packaging
tests and typechecking run on every host. For the initial pinned commit, two precisely
named pre-existing failures may be reported as explicit exceptions: a native-button-title
style violation, and an SSH control-socket path assertion under a long isolated HOME.
The suite is **not called green** when either fails; raw JSON/logs and the exception
classification are retained. Windows also reports one explicit cross-Darwin fixture
exception: a test expects POSIX mode 0755, but Windows exposes 0666. Actual Mac helper
modes and native PTY execution are tested on Macs; no native feature is faked or removed.
This exception is Windows-only. All exceptions apply only to that exact commit.
Temporary Git test directories use GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES so they cannot accidentally
discover or change the enclosing build repository.

Binary architecture checks, ASAR file/integrity/secret-pattern scans, compiled-JS syntax,
archive CRC/roundtrip checks and a real launch of the **extracted distribution** are gates.
On Mac, the original upstream beforePack hook still runs. A wrapper then ad-hoc signs
its final staged native files BEFORE electron-builder hashes them into ASAR. After all
license resources are copied, the pinned `@electron/osx-sign` signs the app inside-out,
using upstream entitlements and hardened runtime, without touching the already-hashed
native payload. Only Mach-O code/bundles are signed; data-file xattr signatures are avoided.
The final bundle and extracted ZIP must pass deep/strict codesign plus explicit unpacked
native-module verification. Deliberately tampered resources and a missing CodeResources
seal must be rejected, and restoring them must recover a byte/mode-identical valid bundle.
Only afterwards is quarantine added to the extracted CI copy for an honest Gatekeeper
assessment. No quarantine removal, security-policy change or local post-install repair.
Pattern scanning is not a universal secrets/malware guarantee. No live credentials are read.
Native Mac/Windows GUI/GPU/peripheral integration, microphone/screen/camera permissions,
Keychain and Finder/app-specific Open Anyway still need user-machine testing.

## CI, releases and updates

Run **Actions → Build standalone desktops → Run workflow**. Standard public-repository
runners are used, never paid larger runners. Builds have only `contents: read` and receive
no signing/API secrets. Artifacts expire after 7 days; Releases are the durable downloads.
Actions are pinned by commit. PRs run tooling tests, not credentialed publish operations.

The daily **Update official Hermes release** workflow follows published, non-prerelease
official releases of `NousResearch/hermes-agent`, not its moving `main` branch. It resolves
the tag to an exact commit, checks ancestry to prevent source downgrades, reads the Desktop
version at that commit, and updates only `upstream.json`. A write race stops the update.
An explicit dispatch then starts the native build at the expected build-repository commit.

The current source pin is newer than the latest official release available when this
automation was introduced. That older release is skipped, not installed as a downgrade.
Node/toolchain changes and patch conflicts still require a maintainer; the workflow never
auto-edits a patch, invents test exceptions, or blindly updates dependencies to make CI pass.
Build revisions are monotonic: upstream Desktop `0.17.0`, revision `3` becomes `0.17.0.3`.
The existing exact-commit test exceptions do not carry forward to another upstream commit.
No in-app update feed is configured.

After a main-branch build succeeds, **Publish verified release** starts automatically via
`workflow_run`. Manual dispatch with the numeric run ID remains available for recovery.
The privilege boundary rejects forks, PR runs, other workflows, incomplete/failed runs,
missing native lanes and commits outside main history before trusting artifacts. It uses
the exact build revision's pin, patch set and validators, even if main advanced meanwhile.
This verifies the successful main-branch run, all four manifests
and local checksums, creates a draft, checks uploaded asset sizes and GitHub SHA256
digests, and only then publishes a normal release with its version number as the title
and explicitly marks it Latest. This controls GitHub presentation, not Apple/Windows
publisher trust or an assertion that all upstream tests pass. A failed pre-publication
validation remains a draft, never a partial public release. Existing versions/assets
are never overwritten. A delayed older build cannot become Latest over a newer version.

Patch hashes and the resulting source state are verified; patched sources are not described
as unmodified. The first-run UI is checked on each real native packaged application. Patch
conflicts, changed behavior, unknown test failures or invalid signatures fail closed: the
last published release remains available. Review failed Actions runs;
GitHub failure notifications depend on the repository/user notification settings.

This publisher does not sync a Homebrew tap. A `hermes-desktop.rb` cask is still
attached to each GitHub Release as a generated asset (URLs and SHA256 for this
repository); it is not installed or audited here.

Publication is separate from the untrusted dependency/build process. Never overwrite
an existing release asset/version. Keep the full build run URL and pin in the
release manifest.
